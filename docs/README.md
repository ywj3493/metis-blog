# Documentation Overview

Use this directory as the knowledge base for Meti's blog project. Files are grouped by responsibility so contributors can quickly locate policies, development practices, feature descriptions, and active work items.

## Directory Map
- `policy/` — Collaboration rules between Meti and Codex, including documentation upkeep and issue governance.
- `dev/` — Engineering handbook covering architecture, naming conventions, environment setup, testing, and deployment workflows.
- `feature/` — Product-level descriptions of current capabilities delivered by the blog.
- `issue/` — Markdown plans for upcoming or in-progress issues. Start by duplicating `issue085.md` and following the workflow in `issue/README.md`.

## How to Use This Docs Space
1. Read `policy/README.md` before contributing to align on expectations.
2. Consult `dev/development-guide.md` for day-to-day engineering questions.
3. Update or extend `feature/` whenever user-facing behaviour changes.
4. Plan every new piece of work through an `issue0XX.md` document (beginning with `issue085.md`) and reference it in commits and pull requests.

Keeping these documents current is part of the definition of done for every issue.
